## Login/Register Modal
This modal will work to sign up the user, validating the data from the server: In the case of password I will need to convert the introduced password into md5 chain. In the register face, I convert the password into md5 chain-characters. 
There are options like register with Google or Login with Google, as extra I want to add a confirmation email once the user is register.

#### Packages
- Axios -> To make petitions in a simple way.
- md5 -> To convert the password into a encrypt password.
- universal cookie -> To store all session variables.
